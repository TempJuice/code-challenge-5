## Instructions

Welcome to your last Code Challenge! In this challenge, you are going to build a MEAN stack application. The application you are going to build is a simple message board.

Just relax and show us what you know! Thanks and good luck!

## Message Board Application

The message board application you are going to build has the following requirements:

- [x] MUST use Angular and MongoDB.

- [x] DO NOT use Angular/client side Routing (ng-Route).

- [x] Your Front End should have two inputs. One for the user's name, the other for the user's message. Additionally, there should be a submit button.

- [x] When the submit button is clicked, you must send the name and message from the inputs to the server to be written to a Mongo Database.

- [x] Once the message has been successfully written to the database, display all messages on the DOM.

- [x] If the application page is reloaded, all previous messages should appear.

No HARD or PRO mode on this.

- [x] Once you have completed the application, please submit via GitHub link, then quietly exit the room.

Thanks!
